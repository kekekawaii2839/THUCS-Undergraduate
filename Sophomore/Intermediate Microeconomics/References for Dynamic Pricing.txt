References for Dynamic Pricing
(Not related to exams! Just for those interested.)

In class (Wednesday section), we briefly mentioned the dynamic pricing problem faced by a monopolist. A survey is:
Elmaghraby, Wedad, and Pınar Keskinocak. "Dynamic pricing in the presence of inventory considerations: Research overview, current practices, and future directions." Management science 49, no. 10 (2003): 1287-1309.

A paper particularly related to sales of concert tickets is:
Gallego, Guillermo, and Garrett Van Ryzin. "Optimal dynamic pricing of inventories with stochastic demand over finite horizons." Management science 40, no. 8 (1994): 999-1020.

To understand the technical details in those papers, you have to know some basics of optimal control theory / calculus of variation. A quick intro to this field of math is Chapter 8-10 of the book:
Sydsæter, Knut, Atle Seierstad, and Arne Strom. Further mathematics for economic analysis. Pearson education, 2008.
